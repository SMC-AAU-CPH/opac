For this\nproject, we aim to build software tools that make it easier to do better\nresearch, especially for managing and working with data. We’ll first be\nbuilding these tools to help support the DD2 initiative.\nWe will be sharing these tools widely and freely, so that as many\nresearch groups as possible can use it for their own projects. Not only\nwill we build these tools to help researchers with managing and sharing\ntheir data, we also will create them with beginner-friendly\ndocumentation and training material to make sure more researchers use\nour tools, no matter their skill level. We believe that with these\ntools, science on health and well-being can become better, ultimately\nhelping people with diabetes and society in general.\n\nSummary\nIn clinical and health research, especially for small- to mid-sized\nresearch groups, funding for building modern, open source software\ninfrastructures for managing and using data has been limited. This gap\nhas naturally led to organizational challenges for managing existing and\nincoming data for many research initiatives, including the Danish Centre\nfor Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) initiative, a national\nresearch collaboration and database initiative established in 2010 with\ncontinual enrollment of persons with type 2 diabetes. The aim of our\nproject is to close this gap by creating and implementing an efficient,\nscalable, and open source data infrastructure framework that connects\ndata collectors, researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders, with\nthe data, documentation, and findings within the DD2 study. This will\nimprove and extend the existing DD2 research infrastructure into an open\nnational state-of-the-art research infrastructure that will provide easy\nand transparent access to this resource for researchers, clinicians and\nstakeholders, thus enabling excellent data science driven research.\nFurthermore, we will create this framework in such a way that other\nresearch groups and companies, who are unable to adequately invest in\nbuilding infrastructures of this type, can relatively easily implement\nit, and modify as needed, for their own purposes. By building this\nframework, we have the potential to help propel research groups and\ncompanies across Denmark (and globally) to quickly getting updated on\nmodern, scalable, and efficient approaches to working with data. Within\nthe DD2 setting, an open, transparent, and easy access to this\nconstantly growing resource has the potential of greatly improving the\ninterest in, use of, and scientific impact of this resource, thus\nleading to substantial scientific and medical advancements,\nindividualised treatment and improved human health in not only persons\nwith type 2 diabetes, but population overall.\nBackground\nIn clinical research, software and data infrastructure development is\nundervalued and, aside from this funding call, underfunded, particularly\nfor small- to mid-sized research organizations. Clinical and health\nresearchers largely lack formal training, support, and awareness in\nresearch software engineering (RSE) and in building and managing data\ninfrastructures. The result is that the overall software and\ncomputational ecosystem, as well as the technical capacities to maintain\nthem, lags behind multiple other scientific domains (e.g.,\nbioinformatics). Particularly with the recent rise of data science and\nthe greater focus on analytical reproducibility, this issue has become\nincreasingly apparent as data, and the skills required to work with it,\nbecome ever larger, more technical, and complex. Indeed, investing in\nand implementing scalable and modern data infrastructures and RSE\nprocesses, built on open source software, have the potential to greatly\nimprove the quality of science, to produce more transparent and\nstreamlined workflows, to lead to reproducible research, and generally\nbetter science in less time (1).\nFunding for participant recruitment and data acquisition has\nhistorically been (and still is) easier to obtain than for building open\nsource software and infrastructures that support and enhance science,\nparticularly for managing and using data. This imbalance has naturally\nled to organizational challenges for managing existing and incoming data\nfor many research initiatives within the field of clinical research,\nincluding for the Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2\nDiabetes (DD2) initiative (2,3).\nDD2 is a national type 2 diabetes (T2D) research collaboration and\ndatabase initiative that was established in 2010, with on-going\nenrollment by hospital physicians and general practitioners (GPs).\nAlthough T2D is a single diagnosis, it comprises several phenotypes with\ndiverse prognoses and risks for complications, which can lead to\ntreatments tailored to each phenotype. The overarching aim of DD2 is to\nimprove and individualise the treatment of persons with T2D. Figure 1\nshows the several datasets within DD2 (4–7). DD2 has\nreceived extensive funding from the Danish Council for Strategic\nResearch and the Novo Nordisk Foundation as well as a Steno National\nCollaborative Grant for deep phenotyping. Continuously recruiting more\nparticipants, adding new data, and expanding the data access to\nresearchers throughout Denmark and abroad has the potential to further\nincrease the value of DD2. However, this comes with higher costs and\nresources for maintaining, extending, and improving on the existing DD2\nresearch infrastructure.\nFigure 1: Summary of the different DD2\ndatabases.Building modern data infrastructures has slowly been taking greater\npriority by funding and research agencies globally. For instance, the UK\nBiobank (8,9) is a\nlarge-scale biomedical database with highly detailed data on ~500,000\nparticipants. It is regularly expanded with additional data and is\nglobally accessible to approved researchers and is a role model to\nbuilding a modern research infrastructure.\nWhile the UK Biobank is a source of inspiration on the\nstate-of-the-art, the underlying infrastructure itself is not openly\naccessible and reusable. The same applies to a similar Danish\ninitiative, the “Single path to access Danish health data”\nproject (10), where the\nDanish government and individual regions are collaborating to map out\nall Danish health data. Another state-of-the-art initiative led by the\nUniversity of Chicago, USA is Gen3 (11), which contains modular open source\nservices that can form the basis for a data infrastructure (12,13) and powers several research\nplatforms, including the National Institutes of Health (14). However, we are unaware of any\nsimilar current national efforts that are open source, re-usable, and\nsuitable for the Danish and EU legal context.\nOur primary aim is to create and implement an efficient, scalable,\nand open source data infrastructure framework that connects\ndata collectors, researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders, with\nthe data, documentation, and findings within the DD2 study. This will\nimprove and extend the existing DD2 into an open national\nstate-of-the-art research infrastructure that will provide easy and\ntransparent access to this resource for researchers, thus enabling\nexcellent data science driven research. Our secondary aim is to create\nthis framework in such a way so that other research groups and\ncompanies, who are unable to adequately invest in building similar\ninfrastructures, can relatively easily implement it and modify as needed\nfor their own purposes.\nMethods\nOur first steps are to build a data infrastructure framework and the\nsecond step is to implement it in DD2. The details of the framework\nitself are described first and later we describe how we will apply it to\nDD2.\nOverview of the\ndata infrastructure framework\nFor this project, the data infrastructure framework is\ndefined as 1) a set of software programs, 2) a defined and fixed set of\nconventions on the structure and format of the filesystem and URL paths,\nand 3) a defined structure to the data and associated documentation, all\nof which are linked together as modular components. The framework will\nserve as an open source starting template for setting up data\ninfrastructures that make use of modern tools and processes.\nThis framework encompasses four target users and three layers, with a\ncomplete schematic shown in Figure 2. The three layers are the web\nportal frontend, the database and documentation backend, and the API\n(Application Programming Interface) that interacts with both. The four\nusers and their associated use cases are:\nUser 1: Those inputting data, e.g.,\nauthorized centers and researchers. The use cases are:\nAuthorized centers (GPs and hospitals) upload standardized and\nroutine data through the data entry web portal.\nAuthorized researchers upload generated data from completed\nprojects. Non-standardized data is manually processed and cleaned before\nentering into the database.\n\nUser 2: Those requesting access, e.g.,\nresearchers and clinicians. Use cases are:\nInterested researchers browse the catalogue of available data and\nthe data dictionary.\nResearchers request access to data by submitting a description of\ntheir proposed project and selecting the relevant data from the\ncatalogue. This request is sent to a list of projects to await approval\nfrom the data controllers (User 4).\n\nUser 3: Those viewing updates on findings and\nresults such as aggregate statistics, e.g., policymakers,\nhealthcare workers, journalists, researchers, and the general public.\nUse cases are:\nUsers view and read through the list of completed, ongoing, and\nproposed projects that use the database.\nUsers access and view aggregate statistics and the latest published\nfindings that are relevant to them/their practice.\n\nUser 4: Administrators and data controllers. Use\ncases are:\nApprove newly submitted projects that request data and manage\nexisting projects.\nApprove and authorize researchers to access the web portal for data\nrequests and to manage current authorized researchers.\nManage collection centers’ access and authorization.\n\nThroughout this application, we’ll refer to these four users and\nthree layers as we expand on and describe the framework.\nFigure 2: Detailed schematic of the data\ninfrastructure framework.Key principles\nunderlying the framework\nTo ensure the development of this framework is efficient and focused,\nit will adhere to key principles that are supported by strong\nphilosophical and scientific rationale:\nFollow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable),\nopen, and transparent principles for the framework itself and to enable\nFAIR principles in the database.\nBe openly licensed and re-usable to facilitate uptake in other\nnational groups (or companies) who are unable to invest in and build\nit.\nUses state-of-the-art principles and tools in software design and\ndevelopment.\nBe beginner-friendly and targeted to (potential) non-computationally\ntechnical users of the framework.\nIn order to maximise the potential for re-use and to minimise the\ntechnical debt and expertise needed to use, maintain, and modify the\nframework, we will use software and tools underlying the framework that\nfit these principles:\nWherever possible, re-use existing material: There already exists\nmany great software tools, infrastructures, and resources that haven’t\nbeen incorporated into common health research practice. We will make use\nof and/or modify these materials where we can.\nBe familiar to or used by researchers currently or within the near\nfuture: To ensure the greatest potential for continued maintenance,\ndevelopment, and use, the framework should use or be built with tools\nand skills that are at least familiar or soon to be familiar to\nresearchers.\nBe familiar to skilled personnel (e.g. research software engineers,\ndata engineers, data scientists): Skilled personnel will build this\nframework and need to be familiar with them.\nBe open source: Software that isn’t open source is by definition not\ntransparent, FAIR, or open. This is a requirement as it will encourage\nwide and easy re-use.\nIntegrates easily with other software: Modular software that follows\ncommon input/output conventions and has well-designed and documented\nAPIs are easier to build with and maintain.\nHistorically stable and reliable: While there are always new\nsoftware being built, maintenance and development is easier when using\nthose that are established.\nLikely to be used in the future or is easily interchangeable with\npotential future tools: Technology progresses quite quickly, so we will\nrely on software that is likely to still be used or can be switched to\nother tools.\nSelected software and tools\nto use\nBased on the above principles, we have chosen the following software\nand conventions to form the framework’s foundation:\nR and/or Python: Are open source and\nestablished.\nRESTful API: REST (representational state transfer)\nis the de facto standard for building APIs.\nCSV, SQL, and JSON format for data storage: Are\nopen source and established formats for data and other web information.\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the Internet’s de facto\nstandard format for information transfer.\nCSV is well known to researchers.\nSQL (a querying language and data storage format) is a widely used\nformat for storing data.\n\nGit, GitLab, and DVC for version control: Formal\nversion control (VC) systems are software that track changes to files\nand are standard practice software engineering. After Git was developed,\nit has increasingly been used by researchers across scientific fields to\nimprove research transparency and openness. GitLab is an open source\nproduct to host Git projects and handles many modern software\ndevelopment tasks. DVC, or Data Version Control, is a machine learning\nVC software for data and models that integrates with Git.\nMarkdown for documentation: Markdown is a common\nweb format and is quickly becoming a standard in data science and even\nwithin many scientific fields. It is a simple syntax for writing\ndocuments that enables easy conversion to file formats like HTML or\nWord. It is simple and portable, so will be used for writing the data\ndictionary, results, documentation, and training material.\nTools for modern web-based interfaces: These\ninclude HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies, as well as\nUser Interface (UI)/User Experience (UX) design principles.\nSoftware development best practices: This includes\nunit testing, continuous integration, and document-driven development\n(to emphasize usability). We’ll use the concept of Minimum Viable\nProduct (MVP) as a means of quickly building something that is minimally\nworkable.\nRe-use of similar infrastructures: Modules from\ninitiatives like Gen3 will either be re-used directly or modified to fit\nour requirements.\nThe framework’s layers\nFrontend interface: The web\nportal\nThis interface is what all users interact with and use, with\nessentially three “permission” levels available:\nFull access: User 4.\nAuthorized access:\nUser 1: A data upload portal that accepts either the routine, known\ndata or new, unknown data from User 2.\nUser 2: A data request portal that allows the user to select\nvariables in the catalogue of data as well as write and submit project\nproposals for access.\n\nPublic access: User 3 would have access to all public pages, which\nincludes the data dictionary, updates on findings, list of current and\npast projects, and a log of any changes or additions to the data.\nAll content would be rendered directly as plain HTML text to ease use\nof existing webpage translation services (e.g. Google Translate), so\nthat content written in another language, i.e., Danish, would still be\nreadable to non-native speakers. This would also lower the amount of\nmaintenance necessary for documentation.\nMiddle-layer: The API\nModern web and computational infrastructures are built on web APIs.\nAny modern online resource or interface makes use of an API, such as\nfrom Google, Gen3, or the UK Biobank. An API is a mechanism by which\ndifferent programs can communicate with one another. They form a set of\ninstructions or conventions that allow easy communication between a user\nand the computer. APIs by their nature are transparent and if\nwell-documented would ensure the linked data would be FAIR, safely and\nsecurely.\nIn this case, the API would be between the user and the web server\nthat stores the underlying database and documentation. The API would be\na combination of a predefined set of instructions that are sent to the\nweb server to run certain commands as well as a set of explicit\nconventions and rules on how files and folders are structured and named.\nTaken together, this API would allow other software like R packages to\nbe built to interact with the backend to automate tasks done by the\nusers.\nBackend: The database\nand documentation\nGiven the heterogeneity in the sources of data input, the backend\nwill need to be composed of multiple components: raw data files as plain\ntext, cleaning and processing programming scripts, a formal database\nstructure (e.g. SQL), a VC system to track changes to the raw data and\nprocessing scripts, a data version numbering system, a changelog\ndescribing the changes, and a data dictionary linked to the variables\ncontained in the database. Versioning of the raw data and scripts is\ndone for recordkeeping, auditing, and transparency, in addition to\nallowing comparison of data used between past and current projects that\nuse the data.\nA major challenge to building the backend is in the heterogeneity of\nthe data input. The key is to establish and enforce a standardized\nCommon Data Model (CDM) for all incoming data at the point of entry. For\nthe framework, the exact contents of the database aren’t important,\nsince as long as the contents follow the CDM it will be programmatically\nmerged into the final formal database. This is necessary as the database\ncontents depend heavily on the research topic and aims of the study that\nwill use this framework.\nThe backend documentation is either largely generated automatically\nor manually written. For instance, the list of projects and findings\nwould be generated by the submitted projects and input from User 2\n(researchers) while the changelog would be updated either by automated\nadditions or, optionally, manually from User 4. The data dictionary\nwould be stored as a JSON file with the documentation text itself as\nMarkdown text. This data dictionary would be publicly accessible and\ncould be updated by anyone (with approval from User 4), potentially\nthrough “Merge Request” mechanisms. This mechanism involves\nautomatically linking any addition or correction back to the main\ndocumentation and requesting it be merged into it.\nUser-to-backend pipeline\nUser 1: Inputting data\nDepending on the source of data, there may already be established\ndata input processes. Substantial amounts of biomedical data, especially\nin Denmark, come from already established, routinely collected clinical\ndata such as from outpatient clinics. For these sources of data, the\ndata input pipeline would involve redirecting these data sources through\nthe API and storage format so the data continues on to the backend.\nSources of data that don’t have well-established data input\nprocesses, such as from hospitals, medical laboratories, and so on,\nwould use the data input portal. This portal would only accept data that\nis in a pre-defined format and would include documentation, and\npotentially automation scripts, on how to pre-process the data prior to\nuploading it.\nOnce the data is submitted through the portal, it would get sent in\nan encrypted, legally-compliant format to the server and stored in the\nway defined by the API and CDM. Any new or updated data that is uploaded\nwould trigger generic automated data cleaning, processing, quality\ncontrol checks of this new data. Any automated processing that is\ndeveloped specific to a project would need to adhere to the API’s\nconventions. If any issues are found or if the data is entirely new to\nthe database, they get sent to a log and User 4 would receive a\nnotification to deal with the issue. If there are no issues or the\nissues have been dealt with, an automated script would take a snapshot\nof the data with the VC system, the version number (based on Semantic Versioning) of the data would be\nupdated, an entry would get added to the changelog, and the formal\ndatabase would get updated.\nUser 2: Requesting access\nResearchers and other users who want to request access to the data\nwould first need their identity verified and then be approved for\nauthorized access. After approval, they would interact with the frontend\nby two routes:\nBrowsing from the catalogue of existing variables in the database,\nalong with the data dictionary and the data changelog, and then\nselecting those variables that are relevant to their project. The\ncatalogue of variables would be a table that is built from the\nunderlying set of files that contain the documentation and that includes\na button to select and save the variables of interest. If they desired,\nthey could also update any errors or types in the data dictionary\nthrough the “Merge Request” mechanism described above.\nWriting a description of the scientific rationale of the project and\nadding any relevant information into a web form that User 4 would use to\ndecide on approval and that would be displayed on the website for User\n3.\nWhen User 4 approves a data request project, it will trigger an API\nrequest that would automatically extract the requested subset of data,\nbundle and encrypt it, and send it to the researcher’s secure server.\nThe framework will contain sufficiently generic methods for automating\nthe data transfer process.\nUser 3: Viewing details\nThe framework assumes that this user would interact with the portal\nthrough at least three routes:\nReading about the database, its history, organizational structure\nand ownership, and any other details in a typical “About” section. Since\nthis is a part of a basic website layout, it is not fully part of the\nframework.\nBrowsing completed and ongoing projects making use of the database,\nalong with the description of the project and variables used. This would\nbe based on a “database” of projects that have requested access to the\ndata, would be stored in JSON format, and through the API specification\nwould be generated into a table on the portal.\nGetting updates on the latest results from the projects and browsing\nsome basic aggregate statistics of some key variables. This would\ninvolve programmatically generating standard aggregate statistics of the\nunderlying database, formatting results according to the API,\ntransferring them to the web server, and have it generated into a\nwebpage format. Overlapping with the second route, key findings from\ncompleted projects can be stored in the projects database and be\ngenerated into a listing on the website.\nUser 4:\nAdministrators and data controllers\nThese users would largely interact with the web portal for managing\nand overseeing ongoing projects, approve access for new researchers, and\napprove projects requesting access to data. Approving new researchers\nwould grant the researchers access permissions to enter the User 2\nportal.\nAdditional key components\nSecurity, privacy, and\nlegality\nThe framework itself does not contain any personal data. When the\nframework is deployed as an infrastructure for a database, only\naggregate statistics, and not individual-level personal data, would be\npublicly accessible. Any personal data would be stored on a secure\nserver that is decided and controlled by User 4, who would be\nresponsible for complying with relevant legal requirements.\nFor data transfers of personal data, either from data collection\ncenters, data generated from researchers, or when transferring data for\napproved projects, we would use well-established and compliant encrypted\ndata transfer processes. Key authentication principles such as\ntwo-factor authentication and OAuth (open standard for access\nauthentication) will be central to the framework to control who can\nupdate or transfer the data. The endpoint of the data transfer is dealt\nwith by the legal teams of the relevant institutions.\nDissemination of framework\nTo be aligned to the goals of openness, transparency, and FAIR\nprinciples, the complete development of the framework will take place\nopenly on GitHub. From there we will link to and promote it through\nvarious outlets, including publications, conferences, and social media.\nThe framework and all its components will be licensed under permissive\ncopyright licenses like the MIT License for the software and the\nCreative Commons Attribution License for non-software content.\nSustainability\nIntegral to this framework is ensuring it is sustainable over the\nlong-term by:\nIntegrating the development of the framework and using it in\nmultiple projects at the host institution Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus\n(SDCA).\nPrototyping MVP to build and document maintenance procedures.\nIncorporating fundamental open source sustainability concepts and\ndocumentation such as writing a Code of Conduct and Contributing\nGuidelines and encouraging external users to contribute.\nIncluding duties for the hired personnel to contribute back to open\nsource software that the framework depends on to help their, and\nindirectly the framework’s, sustainability.\nTraining and educational\ndevelopment\nUsage of this framework depends on the quality of its documentation\nand training material. A key concept we will use heavily is\nDocumentation Driven Development, where the framework’s development is\nguided and informed from the development of the documentation, which\nplaces documentation as a high priority. We will also be creating and\nrunning short workshops and tutorials that teach researchers how they\ncan use this framework.\nResource requirements\nComputational and\nphysical infrastructure\nWhile the proposed framework is software-based, storing and deploying\nthe infrastructure requires server space and IT support. The framework\nitself takes up little space and can optimise computational resources,\nbut the underlying DD2 data requires considerable server space.\nTechnical skills and\npersonnel\nTo have a meaningful impact on improving research infrastructure, the\nminimum skills and knowledge necessary are:\nBuilding and interacting with RESTful APIs (or APIs in general)\nCreating websites and knowledge on UI/UX designs\nDeveloping software/general programming in R/Python\nUsing Git and GitHub/GitLab\nDatabase management/administration\nFamiliar with creating training material and teaching\nExperience in working on open source projects and with FAIR\nprinciples\nExperience in the Danish research computing environments, e.g.,\n“forskermaskine” (research engine on Denmark Statistics (DST))\nApplying the framework to\nDD2\nThe biggest potential challenge to applying the framework to DD2 is\ngetting the database backend into the appropriate structure to fit\nwithin the framework. With the current state of the DD2 data,\nconsiderable time and effort is needed to organize it. Our initial steps\nwill be to:\nSurvey and map out all data, documentation, and processing\nsteps. Currently, the original enrollment data are stored in a\nsecure server at the DD2 headquarters at Odense, while subsets of data\ncollected for specific research projects are spread across several\nresearch institutions.\nMap the data input sources and formats from the various\ncollection centers. GP clinics have an existing pipeline for\nsending data to DD2 through their system, “sundhedsdatanettet” (national\nhealthcare portal), following a patient visit. Other collection centers\nlike hospitals have custom, but not standardized, approaches to sending\ndata to DD2. No formal approach is available for returning data from\ncompleted projects. The core DD2 data is sent to “forskermaskine” and\ngets merged there with the registry data, which is in a standard DST\nformat.\nMove as much data as possible to a central location. All\ndata will be stored at the DD2 headquarters in Odense, except\nlarge-scale data that will be either stored or transferred as needed to\na high-performance computing (HPC) platform. For linkage with registry\ndata, we will acquire a dedicated DD2 “forskermaskine” server.\nRe-structure current data into the framework’s CDM.\nBuild software to automate the cleaning, processing, and merging\nof the existing and established data input pipelines into the\nframework’s required backend format.\nEstablish automated processes for linkages between the data\nstorage servers.\nImplement framework’s remaining modules, starting with User 4\nand then moving from User 1 to 3, in that order.\nCurrently, User 3 can request data by filling out a Word application\nform and emailing it to the chair of the advisory board Kurt Højlund\nand programme leader Jens Steen Nielsen. Applications are reviewed by\nthe steering committee and, once approved, the data manager at the\nDepartment of Clinical Epidemiology (KEA) in Aarhus University Hospital\nthen manually extracts the requested data and transfers the data subset\nto the applicant’s secure server and does this for each individual\nresearch project. If requested, KEA may also perform analyses on the\ndata. Researchers must already have valid authorized access to the\nsecure servers on an existing “forskermaskine” or an HPC\nfacility for the large-scale data, such as Computerome 2 and GenomeDK.\nThe costs of storing the original data are covered by DD2, while\napplicants cover the costs related to storing the transferred data. We\nwill not charge for data access. As per legal requirements, researchers\ncan only use the data for the intended purposes listed in the\napplication. After project completion, the researchers must delete or\nclose access to the data and inform DD2 as legally required. Any newly\ngenerated data must be returned to DD2 by uploading via the User 1\nportal.\nDeliverables and milestones\nBecause the framework will be built with modularity in mind, where\neach component could be used alone or together, nearly all the\ncomponents could be deliverables (each User by each layer). Each\ndeliverable would be to prototype a MVP to begin testing it, identifying\nbugs, getting feedback, and establishing maintenance procedures. See\nFigure 3 for the Gantt chart.\nFigure 3: Gantt chart of deliverables and\ntimelines.Collaborations\nThe framework will be developed at SDCA with Professor Annelli\nSandbæk (applicant) as the lead PI responsible for reaching the overall\ngoals of the project and defined milestones, as well as two postdocs,\nLuke Johnston, MSc, PhD and Alisa Kjærgaard, MD, PhD. A project group\nheaded by the PI will be established that includes central persons from\nSDCA and DD2. In close collaboration with the project manager of DD2 and\nthe current data manager, the deliverables will be planned and carried\nthrough. Completing the proposed project requires hiring data and\nresearch software engineer personnel into the project, which will be the\nfirst step in the project process. The DD2 advisory group will also act\nas the advisory group for this project. This group is chaired by Kurt\nHøjlund, MD, PhD, head of research at Steno Diabetes Center Odense and\ncontains representatives from affiliated research projects and other DD2\nstakeholders.\nSignificance\nWe are at a key point in time within clinical research where it is\nincreasingly being recognized that open source software and\ncomputational infrastructure are critical and necessary components to\nensuring science is high-quality, reproducible, rigorous, and\ntransparent. Funding agencies and research institutions globally are\nputting greater efforts into modernizing many of their infrastructures\nusing the many software technologies that have risen in the last decade.\nBy building this framework, we have the potential to help propel\nresearch groups and companies across Denmark (and globally) to quickly\ngetting updated on modern, scalable, and efficient approaches to working\nwith data.\nWithin the DD2 setting, an open, transparent, and easy access to this\nconstantly growing resource has the potential of greatly improving the\ninterest in, use of, and scientific impact of this resource.\nIncorporating new data generated from the DD2 resource back into DD2\nwill enable other researchers to test or use this data to advance their\nown work. This would lead to substantial scientific and medical\nadvancements, which will ultimately lead to individualised treatment and\nimproved human health in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and very\nlikely the population overall.\n\n\n\n1.
